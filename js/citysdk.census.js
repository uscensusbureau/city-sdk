 * Processes a data request by looking at a JSON request
 *
 * JSON Requests should include:
 * "year" - Year of the request. See acs5years object for available years. Defaults to 2013 if not specified.
 * "lat" - Latitude of the requested location (either specified as x, lat, or latitude) NORTH
 * "lng" - Longitude of the requested location (either specified as y, lng, or longitude) EAST
 * "sublevel" - Defaults to "false". If set to "true", it will return the group of sublevels from the specified level.
 * "level" - Level of the request. Options are: blockGroup, tract, county, state, us. Will default to blockGroup.
 * "variables" - Array of variables either by alias or specific name
 *
 * exampleRequest = {

 *
 *   A response where you set sublevel to "true" will have an array in the data field instead of an object.
